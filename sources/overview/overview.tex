\section{Goals of the Thesis}
The thesis is mainly focused on practical game server development. In the research part, I will analyze existing augmented reality games, research available database management systems and explore frameworks used for server development.

In the practical part, I will specify features and requirements of the server. The goal is to support operations the mobile client might need for seamless gaming experience. These operations include for example getting game objects near a player, or login. The main goal is to implement server's functionality to communicate with clients, parse their requests and respond in valid format. The underlying goals include the need to use a database, caching, and communication with external services. Lastly, the game server prototype should be tested and deployed.	

\section{Game Description}
This is a role-playing mobile game with augmented reality features. Player becomes a character in an invisible alternative reality. He can explore the new, magical world using his phone which displays a map with objects around him. Player can discover monsters, like goblins or skeletons, and fight them to death for a reward. As he gains more experience and gold, he can buy himself more powerful weapons and armor in a shop. Tired of running in the outside world? Player can exchange his real money for in-game gold.

For prototyping purposes, some described features are limited. All available actions are specified in \textit{Features} section of Requirements \ref{section:fr}.
