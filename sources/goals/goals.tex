The thesis is mainly focused on practical game server development. In the research part, I will analyze existing augmented reality games, research available database management systems and explore frameworks used for server development.

In the practical part, I will specify features and requirements of the server. The goal is to support operations the mobile client might need for seamless gaming experience. These operations include for example getting game objects near a player, or login. The main goal is to implement server's functionality to communicate with clients, parse their requests and respond in valid format. The underlying goals include the need to use a database, caching, and communication with external services. Lastly, the game server should be tested and deployed.
