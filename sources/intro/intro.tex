The world of mobile devices is quickly evolving. Smartphones and tablets are becoming more powerful and not only in terms of computational power and available memory. Nowadays, mobile devices are packed with various sensors. It is possible to acquire data from GPS (Global Positioning System) to quickly determine device’s position. This opens us door to augmented
reality (AR) applications. 

Surprisingly, there are not many existing augmented reality games on the market. Thanks to couple successful AR games in recent years, which I will explore later,  public awareness of this genre rapidly rose.

In my bachelor thesis, I will create the server part of a role-playing augmented reality game. I will work in cooperation with Tomáš Zahálka, who works on the client part. I will design and implement a prototype, test it and deploy it.
