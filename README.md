# Location-based Role Playing Game
The world of mobile devices is quickly evolving. Smartphones and tablets are becoming more and more powerful and not only in terms of computational power and available memory. Mobile devices nowadays are packed with various sensors. It is possible to integrate data from GPS (Global Positioning System), accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and camera to quickly determine device's position and orientation. This opens us doors to augmented reality.

In my bachelor thesis, I, in cooperation with Tomáš Zahálka, will create a mobile game for Android which will utilize elements of augmented reality. The game is set in a fantasy world and its genre is RPG (Role Playing Game).
